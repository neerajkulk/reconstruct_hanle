Tried to debug why calculation of scattering polarization is giving me very small intensities. I expect J ~ Planck function. In SI units, I expect J~ 10e-8.Problem boils down to my routine 'write_spherical_tensor' in formal.c

I notice that replacing domg_dlam with wmu results in a J00 with the correct magnitude. Problem seems to ariese due to line->phi being a vary small number. Why? Ask han about this.
